# search.nvim

*"**search.nvim** is a Neovim plugin that enhances the functionality of the [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) plugin by providing a tab-based search experience. It allows you to seamlessly switch between different search modes within the Telescope window using tabs"* - ChatGPT

> [!WARNING]
> this plugin is in early development and might have some bugs. You can also expect changes to the configuration api.

## Features

- **Tab-based Searching**: Easily switch between different search modes, each represented by a tab.
- **Integration with Telescope**: Leverages the power of the Telescope plugin for versatile searching.
- **Customizable Tabs**: Configure the available tabs according to your preferences. (coming soon)
- **keybindings for switching tabs**: switch tabs by configurable keys

## Installation

Install search.nvim using your preferred plugin manager. For example:
```lua
--- lazy nvim
{
    "FabianWirth/search.nvim",
    dependencies = { "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim" }
}
```

## default tabs
the default tabs are:
- find_files
- git_files
- live_grep

they can be configured in the setup function.

## Usage

### Opening the Tabsearch Window
To open the search.nvim window, use the following command:

```lua
require('search').open()
```
This will activate the default tab and open the Telescope window with the specified layout.
it is also possible to provide a tab_id or tab_name to directly activate a specific tab (id takes precedence over name).
Any tab collections defined can also be accessed via the collection key.

```lua
require('search').open({ tab_id = 2 })
require('search').open({ tab_name = 'Grep' }) -- if multiple tabs are named the same, the first is selected
require('search').open({ collection = 'git' }) -- Open the 'git' collection of pickers
```

### Switching Tabs
Navigate between tabs using the **`<Tab>`** and **`<S-Tab>`** keys in normal and insert modes. This allows you to switch between different search modes conveniently.

### Customizing Tabs
You can customize the available tabs by modifying the tabs table in the plugin configuration. Each tab should be defined as a Lua table with the following properties:

- name: Display name of the tab.
- tele_func: The Telescope function associated with the tab.
- available (optional): A function to determine if the tab is currently available based on certain conditions.
For example:

```lua
local builtin = require('telescope.builtin')
require("search").setup({
  mappings = { -- optional: configure the mappings for switching tabs (will be set in normal and insert mode(!))
    next = "<Tab>",
    prev = "<S-Tab>"
  },
  append_tabs = { -- append_tabs will add the provided tabs to the default ones
    {
      "Commits", -- or name = "Commits"
      builtin.git_commits, -- or tele_func = require('telescope.builtin').git_commits
      available = function() -- optional
        return vim.fn.isdirectory(".git") == 1
      end
    }
  },
  -- its also possible to overwrite the default tabs using the tabs key instead of append_tabs
  tabs = {
    {
      "Files",
      function(opts)
        opts = opts or {}
        if vim.fn.isdirectory(".git") == 1 then
          builtin.git_files(opts)
        else
          builtin.find_files(opts)
        end
      end
    }
  },
})
```

### Customizing key bindings
Simple rebind, will bind the the keys in both normal mode and insert mode.
```lua
  mappings = {
    next = "<Tab>",
    prev = "<S-Tab>"
  }
```
You can also bind keys in specific modes by supplying a list of key-mode pairs. The following would bind H and L to previous and next in normal mode
in addition to binding tab and shift+tab like in the example above.
```lua
  mappings = {
    next = { { "L", "n" }, { "<Tab>", "n" }, { "<Tab>", "i" } },
    prev = { { "H", "n" }, { "<S-Tab>", "n" }, { "<S-Tab>", "i" } }
  }
```

### Tab Collections
If you want to group certain pickers together into separate search windows you can use the collections keyword:

```lua
local builtin = require('telescope.builtin')
require("search").setup({
  initial_tab = 1,
  tabs = { ... }, -- As shown above
  collections = {
    -- Here the "git" collection is defined. It follows the same configuraton layout as tabs.
    git = {
      initial_tab = 1, -- Git branches
      tabs = {
        { name = "Branches", tele_func = builtin.git_branches },
        { name = "Commits", tele_func = builtin.git_commits },
        { name = "Stashes", tele_func = builtin.git_stash },
      }
    }
  }
})
``` 

### known issues
- pickers with more-than-average loading time (like lsp related, or http sending pickers) can feel a bit off, since the UI will wait for them to be ready.
- heavily custom configured telescope settings (like in many nvim distros) might lead to unexpected errors, please open an issue if you encounter any.
- A window with no available pickers can cause neovim to hang.
